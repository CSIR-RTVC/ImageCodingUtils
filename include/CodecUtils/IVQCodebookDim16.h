FILE NAME					: IVQCodebookDim16.h

DESCRIPTION				: A IVQCodebookDim16 Interface as an abstract base class to vector 
                    quantiser codebook implementations with vectors of size 16 shorts. 
                    This interface is used to access the codebook holding class 
                    implementations.
