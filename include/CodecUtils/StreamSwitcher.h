/**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Stream Switching operation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Switch() is called on every time sequential frame of the stream.

1.	In the Reset() state the current stream is output and the Switch() method
		is called with the 'to' stream equal to NULL. IsSwitched() == 0.

2.	A call to Switch() with a non-NULL 'to' parameter initiates the switching 
		state machine.

3.	The application monitors IsSwitched() for completion.

4.	On IsSwitched(), Reset() is called and Switch() is called with the old
		'to' stream as the current stream and NULL as the 'to' stream parameter.
