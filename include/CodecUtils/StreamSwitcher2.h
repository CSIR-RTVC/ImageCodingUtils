FILE NAME					: StreamSwitcher2.h

DESCRIPTION				: A class to handle switching between two independent streams
										produced by SwitchCodecs. The output is a single codec 
										stream. This 2nd version encapsulates references to the 
										encoded streams within the class.

/**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Stream Switching operation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: GetNextFrame() is called on every time sequential frame of the stream.

1.	In the Reset() state the current stream is output and the 'to' stream is
		equal to NULL. IsSwitched() == 1.

2.	A call to Switch() with a non-NULL 'to' parameter initiates the switching 
		state machine.

3.	The application monitors IsSwitched() for completion.

4.	On IsSwitched(), the new 'to' stream becomes the current stream and the
		old current stream is set to NULL.

5.	Note that the stream pointers must hold const buffers that do not change
		during switching. The only oportunity to change a stream is via the call
		to the Switch() method.
